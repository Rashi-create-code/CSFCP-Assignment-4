# Project Overview

This project is a simple Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was created as part of Assignment 4 for the course *Computer Science Fundamentals & Career Pathways*.

The goal of the project is to understand how to:
- Write and run Python programs in VS Code  
- Use Git for version control  
- Commit meaningful changes  
- Host a project on GitHub  
- Document the project using Markdown

The calculator is easy to use, handles invalid inputs, and can perform multiple calculations in one run.
