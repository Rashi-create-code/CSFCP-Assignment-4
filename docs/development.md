# Development Process

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Python
- Git
- GitHub

## Steps Followed
1. Created a project folder and opened it in VS Code.
2. Wrote the initial version of `calculator.py` with basic arithmetic operations.
3. Initialized a Git repository using `git init`.
4. Added files using `git add` and created multiple meaningful commits using `git commit`.
5. Improved the calculator by adding input validation, operator checks, better output formatting, and looping.
6. Created a `.gitignore` file to ignore unnecessary folders such as `__pycache__/` and `.vscode/`.
7. Added and committed a README file and documentation.
8. Created a new GitHub repository and pushed the project using `git push`.

## Git Commands Used
- `git init` – To start the repository  
- `git add` – To stage changes  
- `git commit` – To save changes  
- `git push` – To upload to GitHub  
- `git branch` / `git checkout` – (Optional) for bonus collaboration

## Challenges Faced
- Handling invalid input from users  
- Formatting results neatly  
- Understanding which files should be ignored by Git

## Final Outcome
A fully functional calculator project with proper documentation and version control.
